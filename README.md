## Contributions Guidelines

### Branch Structure

The project uses the following branch structure:

- **main branch**: This branch contains the stable version of the application and is only updated with fully tested and approved features.
- **develop branch**: This branch serves as the integration branch for all new features and bug fixes. All development work should be based on this branch.

### Working with Issues
1. Creating an Issue:
- Before starting any new feature or bug fix, create a new issue in the repository. Each issue should provide a clear description of the task, enhancement, or bug to be addressed.
- You can create a new branch directly when creating the issue by using the option to "Create a branch for this issue". This ensures that each branch is directly linked to the corresponding issue.

2. Submitting Changes:
- After completing work on your branch, submit a pull request (PR) to the develop branch. In the PR description, reference the issue number and provide a summary of the changes.
- Make sure to request a review from at least one team member before merging the changes to develop.
- Once the feature has been reviewed and tested, it will be merged into the main branch after approval.
